## Introduction

Welcome to the Automated IC Testing Application repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for automated testing of integrated circuits (ICs) using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The system is designed to be scalable, flexible, and capable of accommodating various IC types and testing methodologies.

## Other Sub Topics

## Overview

This application leverages FPGA technology to automate the testing process for integrated circuits, focusing on memory modules in this example. The FPGA serves as the core processing unit, controlling the testing procedure, generating test patterns, processing data, and providing test results.

## Features

- Automated testing of memory modules using FPGA.
- Scalable architecture for testing multiple ICs in parallel.
- User-friendly graphical user interface for test configuration and result visualization.
- Modular design allowing easy addition of new IC types and testing methods.
- Support for various testing standards and protocols.
